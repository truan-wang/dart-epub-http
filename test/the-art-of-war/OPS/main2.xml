<div class="text">
<p><span class="foreign">Sun Tzu Wu</span> was a native of the
<span class="foreign">Ch`i</span> State. His <em>Art of War</em>
brought him to the notice of <span class="foreign">Ho Lu</span>,
King of <span class="foreign">Wu</span>. <span class="foreign">Ho
Lu</span> said to him: “I have carefully perused your 13 chapters.
May I submit your theory of managing soldiers to a slight
test?”</p>
<p><span class="foreign">Sun Tzu</span> replied: “You may.”</p>
<p><span class="foreign">Ho Lu</span> asked: “May the test be
applied to women?”</p>
<p>The answer was again in the affirmative, so arrangements were
made to bring 180 ladies out of the Palace. <span class=
"foreign">Sun Tzu</span> divided them into two companies, and
placed one of the King's favourite concubines at the head of each.
He then bade them all take spears in their hands, and addressed
them thus: “I presume you know the difference between front and
back, right hand and left hand?”</p>
<p>The girls replied: “Yes.”</p>
<p><span class="foreign">Sun Tzu</span> went on: “When I say ‘Eyes
front,’ you must look straight ahead. When I say ‘Left turn,’ you
must face towards your left hand. When I say ‘Right turn,’ you must
face towards your right hand. When I say ‘About turn,’ you must
face right round towards your back.”</p>
<p>Again the girls assented. The words of command having been thus
explained, he set up the halberds and battle-axes in order to begin
the drill. Then, to the sound of drums, he gave the order “Right
turn.” But the girls only burst out laughing. <span class=
"foreign">Sun Tzu</span> said: “If words of command are not clear
and distinct, if orders are not thoroughly understood, then the
general is to blame.”</p>
<p>So he started drilling them again, and this time gave the order
“Left turn,” whereupon the girls once more burst into fits of
laughter. <span class="foreign">Sun Tzu</span>: “If words of
command are not clear and distinct, if orders are not thoroughly
understood, the general is to blame. But if his orders <em>are</em>
clear, and the soldiers nevertheless disobey, then it is the fault
of their officers.”</p>
<p>So saying, he ordered the leaders of the two companies to be
beheaded. Now the King of <span class="foreign">Wu</span> was
watching the scene from the top of a raised pavilion; and when he
saw that his favourite concubines were about to be executed, he was
greatly alarmed and hurriedly sent down the following message: “We
are now quite satisfied as to our general's ability to handle
troops. If We are bereft of these two concubines, our meat and
drink will lose their savour. It is our wish that they shall not be
beheaded.”</p>
<p><span class="foreign">Sun Tzu</span> replied: “Having once
received His Majesty's commission to be the general of his forces,
there are certain commands of His Majesty which, acting in that
capacity, I am unable to accept.”</p>
<p>Accordingly, he had the two leaders beheaded, and straightway
installed the pair next in order as leaders in their place. When
this had been done, the drum was sounded for the drill once more;
and the girls went through all the evolutions, turning to the right
or to the left, marching ahead or wheeling back, kneeling or
standing, with perfect accuracy and precision, not venturing to
utter a sound. Then <span class="foreign">Sun Tzu</span> sent a
messenger to the King saying: “Your soldiers, Sire, are now
properly drilled and disciplined, and ready for your majesty's
inspection. They can be put to any use that their sovereign may
desire; bid them go through fire and water, and they will not
disobey.”</p>
<p>But the King replied: “Let our general cease drilling and return
to camp. As for us, We have no wish to come down and inspect the
troops.”</p>
<p>Thereupon <span class="foreign">Sun Tzu</span> said: “The King
is only fond of words, and cannot translate them into deeds.”</p>
<p>After that, <span class="foreign">Ho Lu</span> saw that
<span class="foreign">Sun Tzu</span> was one who knew how to handle
an army, and finally appointed him general. In the west, he
defeated the <span class="foreign">Ch`u</span> State and forced his
way into <span class="foreign">Ying</span>, the capital; to the
north he put fear into the States of <span class=
"foreign">Ch`i</span> and <span class="foreign">Chin</span>, and
spread his fame abroad amongst the feudal princes. And <span class=
"foreign">Sun Tzu</span> shared in the might of the King.</p>
