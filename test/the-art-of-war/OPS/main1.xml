<div class="text">
<p>Lionel Giles' ground-breaking 1910 edition of Sun Tzu's ancient
treatise on the Art of War was nothing short of a scholarly
masterpiece.&#160; It contains the original Chinese text, an
accurate and fancy-free yet highly readable translation, extensive
annotations by both ancient Chinese commentators and Giles himself,
and a vast introduction to provide an in-depth historical
perspective to it all.&#160; Despite not having become the final
word on Art of War translations, this now public domain text of a
brilliant Orientalist remains an ideal yardstick against which
other translations can be measured.</p>
<p>This edition aims to offer the reader the full Lionel Giles
translation, sans the annotations, corrected of the many small
errors and outright omissions present in most freely distributed
digital copies of the work<a class="footnote" href=
"footnotes.xml#footnote_1" id="footnote_1_call">[1]</a>.&#160; And
instead of the lengthy and necessarily dry academic introduction of
the original, our book begins with the fascinating ancient Chinese
anecdote about Sun Tzu and the Emperor's concubines.</p>
