The Attack by Fire</h2>
<div class="text">
<ol>
<li>
<p><span class="foreign">Sun Tzu</span> said: There are five ways
of attacking with fire. The first is to burn soldiers in their
camp; the second is to burn stores; the third is to burn
baggage-trains; the fourth is to burn arsenals and magazines; the
fifth is to hurl dropping fire amongst the enemy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In order to carry out an attack with fire, we must have means
available. The material for raising fire should always be kept in
readiness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is a proper season for making attacks with fire, and
special days for starting a conflagration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The proper season is when the weather is very dry; the special
days are those when the moon is in the constellations of the Sieve,
the Wall, the Wing or the Cross-bar; for these four are all days of
rising wind.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In attacking with fire, one should be prepared to meet five
possible developments:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(1)&#160;When fire breaks out inside the enemy's camp, respond
at once with an attack from without.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(2)&#160;If there is an outbreak of fire, but the enemy's
soldiers remain quiet, bide your time and do not attack.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(3)&#160;When the force of the flames has reached its height,
follow it up with an attack, if that is practicable; if not, stay
where you are.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(4)&#160;If it is possible to make an assault with fire from
without, do not wait for it to break out within, but deliver your
attack at a favourable moment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(5)&#160;When you start a fire, be to windward of it. Do not
attack from the leeward.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A wind that rises in the daytime lasts long, but a night breeze
soon falls.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In every army, the five developments connected with fire must be
known, the movements of the stars calculated, and a watch kept for
the proper days.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hence those who use fire as an aid to the attack show
intelligence; those who use water as an aid to the attack gain an
accession of strength.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By means of water, an enemy may be intercepted, but not robbed
of all his belongings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unhappy is the fate of one who tries to win his battles and
succeed in his attacks without cultivating the spirit of
enterprise; for the result is waste of time and general
stagnation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hence the saying: The enlightened ruler lays his plans well
ahead; the good general cultivates his resources.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Move not unless you see an advantage; use not your troops unless
there is something to be gained; fight not unless the position is
critical.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No ruler should put troops into the field merely to gratify his
own spleen; no general should fight a battle simply out of
pique.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If it is to your advantage, make a forward move; if not, stay
where you are.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Anger may in time change to gladness; vexation may be succeeded
by content.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>But a kingdom that has once been destroyed can never come again
into being; nor can the dead ever be brought back to life.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hence the enlightened ruler is heedful, and the good general
full of caution. This is the way to keep a country at peace and an
army intact.</p>
