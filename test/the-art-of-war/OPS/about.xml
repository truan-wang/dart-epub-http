<p>Sun Tzu was a Chinese author of The Art of War, an immensely
influential ancient Chinese book on military strategy. He is also
one of the earliest realists in international relations theory. The
name Sun Tzu ("Master Sun") is an honorific title bestowed upon Sun
Wu, the author's name. The character wu, meaning "military", is the
same as the character in wu shu, or martial art. Sun Wu also has a
courtesy name, Chang Qing. Source: Wikipedia</p>
