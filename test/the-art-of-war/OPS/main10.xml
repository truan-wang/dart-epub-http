Variation in Tactics</h2>
<div class="text">
<ol>
<li>
<p><span class="foreign">Sun Tzu</span> said: In war, the general
receives his commands from the sovereign, collects his army and
concentrates his forces</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When in difficult country, do not encamp. In country where high
roads intersect, join hands with your allies. Do not linger in
dangerously isolated positions. In hemmed-in situations, you must
resort to stratagem. In a desperate position, you must fight.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are roads which must not be followed, armies which must
not be attacked, towns which must not be besieged, positions which
must not be contested, commands of the sovereign which must not be
obeyed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The general who thoroughly understands the advantages that
accompany variation of tactics knows how to handle his troops.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The general who does not understand these, may be well
acquainted with the configuration of the country, yet he will not
be able to turn his knowledge to practical account.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So, the student of war who is unversed in the art of varying his
plans, even though he be acquainted with the Five Advantages, will
fail to make the best use of his men.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hence in the wise leader's plans, considerations of advantage
and of disadvantage will be blended together.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If our expectation of advantage be tempered in this way, we may
succeed in accomplishing the essential part of our schemes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If, on the other hand, in the midst of difficulties we are
always ready to seize an advantage, we may extricate ourselves from
misfortune.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reduce the hostile chiefs by inflicting damage on them; make
trouble for them, and keep them constantly engaged; hold out
specious allurements, and make them rush to any given point.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The art of war teaches us to rely not on the likelihood of the
enemy's not coming, but on our own readiness to receive him; not on
the chance of his not attacking, but rather on the fact that we
have made our position unassailable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are five dangerous faults which may affect a
general:<br /></p>

</td>

<p>over-solicitude for his men, which exposes him to worry and
trouble.</p>
</td>

</table>
</li>
<li>
<p>These are the five besetting sins of a general, ruinous to the
conduct of war.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When an army is overthrown and its leader slain, the cause will
surely be found among these five dangerous faults. Let them be a
subject of meditation.</p>
