Weak Points and Strong</h2>
<div class="text">

<li>
<p><span class="foreign">Sun Tzu</span> said: Whoever is first in
the field and awaits the coming of the enemy, will be fresh for the
fight; whoever is second in the field and has to hasten to battle
will arrive exhausted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Therefore the clever combatant imposes his will on the enemy,
but does not allow the enemy's will to be imposed on him.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By holding out advantages to him, he can cause the enemy to
approach of his own accord; or, by inflicting damage, he can make
it impossible for the enemy to draw near.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the enemy is taking his ease, he can harass him; if well
supplied with food, he can starve him out; if quietly encamped, he
can force him to move.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Appear at points which the enemy must hasten to defend; march
swiftly to places where you are not expected.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An army may march great distances without distress, if it
marches through country where the enemy is not.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can be sure of succeeding in your attacks if you only attack
places which are undefended.You can ensure the safety of your
defence if you only hold positions that cannot be attacked.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hence that general is skillful in attack whose opponent does not
know what to defend; and he is skillful in defence whose opponent
does not know what to attack.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>O divine art of subtlety and secrecy! Through you we learn to be
invisible, through you inaudible; and hence we can hold the enemy's
fate in our hands.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You may advance and be absolutely irresistible, if you make for
the enemy's weak points; you may retire and be safe from pursuit if
your movements are more rapid than those of the enemy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If we wish to fight, the enemy can be forced to an engagement
even though he be sheltered behind a high rampart and a deep ditch.
All we need do is to attack some other place that he will be
obliged to relieve.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If we do not wish to fight, we can prevent the enemy from
engaging us even though the lines of our encampment be merely
traced out on the ground. All we need do is to throw something odd
and unaccountable in his way.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By discovering the enemy's dispositions and remaining invisible
ourselves, we can keep our forces concentrated, while the enemy's
must be divided.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We can form a single united body, while the enemy must split up
into fractions. Hence there will be a whole pitted against separate
parts of a whole, which means that we shall be many to the enemy's
few.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And if we are able thus to attack an inferior force with a
superior one, our opponents will be in dire straits.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The spot where we intend to fight must not be made known; for
then the enemy will have to prepare against a possible attack at
several different points; and his forces being thus distributed in
many directions, the numbers we shall have to face at any given
point will be proportionately few.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For should the enemy strengthen his van, he will weaken his
rear; should he strengthen his rear, he will weaken his van; should
he strengthen his left, he will weaken his right; should he
strengthen his right, he will weaken his left. If he sends
reinforcements everywhere, he will everywhere be weak.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Numerical weakness comes from having to prepare against possible
attacks; numerical strength, from compelling our adversary to make
these preparations against us.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Knowing the place and the time of the coming battle, we may
concentrate from the greatest distances in order to fight.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>But if neither time nor place be known, then the left wing will
be impotent to succour the right, the right equally impotent to
succour the left, the van unable to relieve the rear, or the rear
to support the van. How much more so if the furthest portions of
the army are anything under a hundred <span class=
"foreign">Li</span> apart, and even the nearest are separated by
several <span class="foreign">Li</span>!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Though according to my estimate the soldiers of <span class=
"foreign">Yüeh</span> exceed our own in number, that shall
advantage them nothing in the matter of victory. I say then that
victory can be achieved.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Though the enemy be stronger in numbers, we may prevent him from
fighting. Scheme so as to discover his plans and the likelihood of
their success.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rouse him, and learn the principle of his activity or
inactivity. Force him to reveal himself, so as to find out his
vulnerable spots.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Carefully compare the opposing army with your own, so that you
may know where strength is superabundant and where it is
deficient.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In making tactical dispositions, the highest pitch you can
attain is to conceal them; conceal your dispositions, and you will
be safe from the prying of the subtlest spies, from the
machinations of the wisest brains.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How victory may be produced for them out of the enemy's own
tactics&#160;— that is what the multitude cannot comprehend.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All men can see the tactics whereby I conquer, but what none can
see is the strategy out of which victory is evolved.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do not repeat the tactics which have gained you one victory, but
let your methods be regulated by the infinite variety of
circumstances.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Military tactics are like unto water; for water in its natural
course runs away from high places and hastens downwards.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So in war, the way is to avoid what is strong and to strike at
what is weak.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Water shapes its course according to the nature of the ground
over which it flows; the soldier works out his victory in relation
to the foe whom he is facing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Therefore, just as water retains no constant shape, so in
warfare there are no constant conditions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He who can modify his tactics in relation to his opponent and
thereby succeed in winning, may be called a heaven-born
captain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The five elements are not always equally predominant; the four
seasons make way for each other in turn. There are short days and
long; the moon has its periods of waning and waxing.</p>
